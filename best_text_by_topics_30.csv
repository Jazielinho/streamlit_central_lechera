 There will be a tractor unit. “This time, no limits.” It will be on May 16 and in Oviedo. The spokespersons of the unions and agrarian entities that signed the 'rural contract', the manifesto with seven requests that seek to be signed by all the groups represented at the General Meeting -SOE, PP, Ciudadanos, Podemos, IU, Foro and Vox-, have given the go-ahead to the mobilization after failing to achieve unanimous support for their proposal.


Yesterday was a key day, since the seven-day deadline given by the authors of the 'rural contract' - the Asturian Rural Union (URA), the Union of Asturian Peasants (UCA), the Union of Agricultural Sectors of Asturias (Usaga), the Coordinator of Farmer and Livestock Organizations (COAG) and the Agricultural Association of Young Farmers (Asaja) - for the signing of the document."

Oviedo (EFE) .- The production of the Asturian industry fell by 2 percent year-on-year in February, which in the cumulative rate of the first quarter it fell by 3.4 percent compared to the same period last year, largely due to the breakdown in one of the ArcelorMittal kilns, according to the index prepared by the Asturian Society for Economic and Industrial Studies (Sadei).
 
In her report, Sadei points out that the regional industry reduced its production level in March, in contrast to the 0.2 percent increase in February, which ended five consecutive months of declines, 'heavily conditioned by some unforeseen events that delay, once again, a hypothetical recovery'."
8,"The Asturian industry returns to positive rates after six months of decline .- Asturian industrial production grew again in March for the first time in six months at an annual rate, despite the fact that energy production contracted by 22.2%, and was above the national average, with an increase of 6% compared to the same month of the previous year, seven tenths above the national average increase (5.3%), according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). 
 
 In any case, this is a recovery that is still discrete. It ranks tenth in the region by industrial progression, after a large part of 2021 and some months of 2022 it had a strong post-Covid comeback, with year-on-year double-digit increases that in some cases reached 60.4% compared to the same month of the previous year."

The dean of the Asturian institutes, founded by Gaspar de Xovellanos, begins this week what will be the first Xornaes of Llingua Asturiana, with activities that will touch on the linguistic question from different points of view. “The idea is to give a broad vision of the possibilities of language, not focusing on literature, which will also have so space, but rather touch on the usu of the Asturian language in the field of the most current communication and the ociu, for example”, explains Inaciu Galán, professor of Asturian Language and Literature at the center, who coordinates the activities with the collaboration of Professor Marta Mori."

.
🙇🏻 De lo que no hay duda es de que Central Lechera Asturiana se está poniendo las pilas en esto de la innovación (como puede verse también en el post de los batidos de leche+cacao que subimos hace unos días)
.
En la comparativa, 4 referencias. Las 2 primeras se diferencian en el uso de la leche desnatada para así conseguir una versión apta para intolerantes a la lactosa (curioso que no añadan lactasa)
.
💁🏼‍♀️ La tercera (light) contiene un 45% menos de grasa que la versión más “fat”: usa nata ligera y además menos cantidad de azúcar que los 2 primeros. Sin embargo añade fibras (que se está usando de un tiempo a esta parte también por su función edulcorante) y maltodextrina (ni mejor ni peor, pero se añade).
.
🥛 La última novedad elimina todo tipo de azúcares añadidos y edulcorantes, obteniendo menos azúcares totales pero la misma cantidad de grasa que la versión convencional. Algo más cara que las demás.
.
Te leemos: ¿menos grasa o menos azúcar? Mójate!
