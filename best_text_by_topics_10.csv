Receta: Pitu de Caleya guisado con patatinos.

Ingredientes:
1 pitu de caleya de 3
kilos aproximadamente,
5 cebollas medianas,
1 cabeza de ajos,
1 pimiento verde
grande,
una pizca de piment√≥n,
250 ml de Jerez seco,
250 gramos de mantequilla rulo de Central Lechera Asturiana
200 ml de co√±ac
Sal
harina para espolvorear la carne
12 patatinos nuevos

Elaboraci√≥n:
Trocear el pollo en octavos, echarlo en un bol con los dientes de ajo pelados y la mitad del Jerez seco. Dejarlo en adobo durante una noche. Al d√≠a siguiente escurrir la carne, secarla con papel de cocina, salarla y pasarla ligeramente por harina sacudiendo el
exceso. Poner una sart√©n con la mantequilla de Central Lechera y fre√≠r el pollo hasta que est√© ligeramente dorado. Sacar el pitu y reservar.
Con la mantequilla que haya quedado en la cazuela, echar la cebolla y el pimiento verde picado en trozos menudos. A√±adir los ajos y pochar hasta que quede de un color marron claro. Poner los trozos de pitu de caleya, echar la pizca de piment√≥n y revolver. A√±adir el vino restante, el del adobo y medio vaso de agua, dej√°ndolo cocer durante
hora y media a fuego medio vigilando que no se pegue. Si hace falta mas liquido, a√±adir algo de caldo de pollo o agua.
Cuando pase el tiempo, a√±adir el co√±ac y dejar cocer otra hora y
media m√°s, a fuego suave. En caso de que se consumiera el
l√≠quido ir echando peque√±os pocillos de agua para mantener la
salsa.
Cuando falten treinta a√±adir los patatinos nuevos al guiso para que se terminen de hacer en √©l."
