At the age of 18, Gavi is the undisputed starter in Barça and in the Spanish national team. He has all the Spanish journalism of the Central Lechera against him.

We left it there."

4,"The problem in the Vinicius case is that for the dairy farm, Vinicius' behavior is always correct, but when another player does it, Neymar is at the time the player's fault. Different measuring sticks. If Vinicius played for another team, he wouldn't be defended the same way."

Right now they sell us that going third reinforces them for the cup final and they will tell us that this is now the prestigious title."

7,The media campaign of the milk farm begins to discredit and detract from the value of the League because everything points to Barça de Xavi winning it. It's a damn shame that the gentlemen of @ElGolazoDeGol ask the question of “does this Liga have value?”
7,"24 hours later, they are still choking, moving all the machinery of the dairy plant from the capital using fake videos and using all of Florentino's marketing.

Disgust of racism, disgust of Real Madrid and disgust of the capital"
7,The dairy farm keeps giving him that I hit you. Diego López's goal doesn't come anywhere. We only talk about the stupid Madrid player of color. One more of the many in the plateau squad and the only one that has problems in all the stadiums. And we don't talk about the Champions League either

Receta: Pitu de Caleya guisado con patatinos.

Ingredientes:
1 pitu de caleya de 3
kilos aproximadamente,
5 cebollas medianas,
1 cabeza de ajos,
1 pimiento verde
grande,
una pizca de pimentón,
250 ml de Jerez seco,
250 gramos de mantequilla rulo de Central Lechera Asturiana
200 ml de coñac
Sal
harina para espolvorear la carne
12 patatinos nuevos

Elaboración:
Trocear el pollo en octavos, echarlo en un bol con los dientes de ajo pelados y la mitad del Jerez seco. Dejarlo en adobo durante una noche. Al día siguiente escurrir la carne, secarla con papel de cocina, salarla y pasarla ligeramente por harina sacudiendo el
exceso. Poner una sartén con la mantequilla de Central Lechera y freír el pollo hasta que esté ligeramente dorado. Sacar el pitu y reservar.
Con la mantequilla que haya quedado en la cazuela, echar la cebolla y el pimiento verde picado en trozos menudos. Añadir los ajos y pochar hasta que quede de un color marron claro. Poner los trozos de pitu de caleya, echar la pizca de pimentón y revolver. Añadir el vino restante, el del adobo y medio vaso de agua, dejándolo cocer durante
hora y media a fuego medio vigilando que no se pegue. Si hace falta mas liquido, añadir algo de caldo de pollo o agua.
Cuando pase el tiempo, añadir el coñac y dejar cocer otra hora y
media más, a fuego suave. En caso de que se consumiera el
líquido ir echando pequeños pocillos de agua para mantener la
salsa.
Cuando falten treinta añadir los patatinos nuevos al guiso para que se terminen de hacer en él."
